# MACHINE LEARNING MODEL FOR KING COUNTY HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
In this project, I developed deep learning regression model for prediction of value of house/apartments at the King County including Seattle. I also built a web application for the model using flask for the backend and Vue Js for the front end. The backend and frontend are linked and the app is working perfectly well.
